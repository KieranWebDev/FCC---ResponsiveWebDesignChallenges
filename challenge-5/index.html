            Hi, I’m Kieran, a Front-End Developer and a recent graduate of The
            School of Code’s 16-week intensive BootCamp.
        </p>
        <p class="heading-p">
            Before beginning my journey into Tech I was an English Teacher for 9
            years working in over 6 countries. I am now hoping to make a career
            pivot into the exciting world of tech.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I began coding during the COVID lockdown and quickly fell in love
                with it after I managed to center my first div. Since then I have
                been on an exciting learning journey full of exhilarating peaks and
                character-building troughs. I love the joys of sharing the wins and
                small triumphs with my teams and coding partners, as we move towards
                our common goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include running, resistance training, reading, gaming and
                playing fetch with my favourite canine, Dori. I enjoy travelling and
                exploring new worlds, but to be honest, as I get deeper into my
                thirties, my perfect evening often involves lounging on a sofa
                whilst watching a good movie with my girlfriend.
            </p>

                I have been taking part in the 100 days of code challenge and have

                Github.
